---
## Dark Forces
We make it to the South beach of Lake Zarovich with rain pouring down
- [[Effarig]] notices many footprints in the sand 
	- There seems to be a set of 4, heading East 
- There is a dock that way with a small ship and a rowboat tied up
	- Another spot where a boat was tied up but the ropes holding it were cut
- [[Lionel]] smells someone in the distance
	- Smells like glue and feathers, most likely the fletcher we have heard about
	- Heading that way, [[Effarig]] sees an outline of a body
	- [[Lionel]] checks the pulse to find it slow but beating
	- Roots and vines come up around the body as twig blights and a shambling mass of vegetation come out of the woods
- During the fight we notice there is a staff inside the giant mass of plants
	- [[Revach]] reaches into it and pulls it out and all the plants alive die 
		- [[Lionel]] tests the green gem on the blights finding it makes them grow but not come back to life
	- [[Effarig]] can tell the staff is from a Gulthias Tree
		- The shambling mound was a Gulthias Tree and must have been very old to have this staff
		- They grow from the blood of an evil and powerful creature, poisoning the ground around it
	- [[Lionel]] takes a sample of the sap
	- [[Aeceran]] checks on the guy on the ground
		- He is unconscious but still alive
- [[Aeceran]] gives the fletcher a potion and he comes to
	- He asks who we are and if [[Arabella]] is ok
	- [[Arabella]] took the boat out in the lake
	- He is going back to the camp and tells us to be careful of an ancient god in the lake
	- Says his name is Ceregal

## Ancient Gods
We all load up into the remaining rowboat, knowing better than to try and pilot the larger boat 
- We think with two rowing and the waves, it will take an hour to get to the middle of the lake
- Far in the distance we can see [[Arabella]] 

We get closer when we hear a song 
- There are harpies singing to us and most of the party is charmed
- [[Arabella]] is on the edge of a whirlpool at the center of the lake
	- Everyone charmed is compelled to join her 
- The whirlpool continues to grow larger as [[Revach]] sees more enemies coming up from the water
- [[Aeceran]] tries to command a harpies to bring [[Arabella]] to us
	- They are able to resist saying, "The lord demands a sacrifice"
- [[Lionel]] throws a rope to try and grab [[Arabella]]
	- She jumps into the water as [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] tries to pull her up but falls in himself
- We are able to get them both back in the boat and an Astral Dreadnought, 45 ft. across, emerges from the water swallowing [[Arabella]]'s boat and a harpy
- [[Revach]] and [[Lionel]] fight off our last assailants and row back to shore

## Runaways
We are able to row back to shore 
- [[Arabella]] appears to be 16 or 17
- She asks if we know what that was 
	- [[Lionel]] says it is an ever-hungry demiplane, sending everything it eats to a unique demiplane 
- [[Arabella]] asks who we are 
	- We offered to help go look for her 
	- She pleads for us to not bring her back 
		- Her father doesn't understand that she doesn't want to live like him 
		- She met someone in Everlund who she wants to get back to 
		- She has recently been able to use magic and everyone is treating her different
- [[Aeceran]] offers to take her to another camp
	- She offers to bring us back to [[05 Faerun|Faerun]]
	- We say we are heading to Krezk and can take her there with us
	- We ask some more about the guy she is into and she says he is a teleporter - the guy Wilfyr scared the piss out of in Storm King's Thunder

[[Aeceran]] uses a disguise kit to make [[Arabella]] look like someone else
- The lightning has become more natural
- We head down the path South to meet the [[Vistani]] coming up
- [[Arabella]] wrote a note saying she was leaving
	- [[Aeceran]] says it was wedged in the rowboat left at the dock
	- The boat that went into the water just disappeared
	- The leader of the [[Vistani]] group says he must ride to [[Castle Ravenloft|The Castle]] immediately

We make our way back to [[Vallaki]]
- [[Aeceran]] talks with the group about his ring 
	- He believes [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] can control him through it, he cannot take it off 
- Make it back toward [[Vallaki]] as the rain is dying down
	- The fletcher has some cool upgrades to our gear and cheap ammo

The party hits level 7
