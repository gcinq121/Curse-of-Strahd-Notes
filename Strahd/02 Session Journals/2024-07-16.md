%% These are now from months ago soooo the details here are not going to be as good as previous "episodes" %%

## Not Dead Yet
During the combat of the previous session with the hags
- [[Revach]] rages and Aeris appears saying there is someone who wants to meet you and reveals a small child
	- The ghost of an old knight pulls out of [[Revach]], nods, salutes, and puts himself between [[Revach]] and the hags
- Combat continues except with the hags eventually going into a panic and calling [[Lionel]] the Lord of Teeth 
	- [[Lionel]] tells everyone else to leave and the hags seem apologetic for what happened
	- The other two hags stop [[Effarig]] and [[Revach]], paralyzing them 
	- Morgantha, one of the hags, says they are grabbing their things and going
		- She says to please not tell "the third eye"
		- [[Lionel]] warns them that the next time we see them they are dead
		- Morgantha offers a jar of teeth and says the children upstairs are ours and all the hags vanish
- [[Effarig]] goes upstairs to take care of the children and [[Revach]] just walks out into the rain
	- Finds 2 babies crying and 2 others completely expressionless
- [[Lionel]] and [[Effarig]] cannot find anything moving around and the hags seem to have completely disappeared
- Looking at the teeth, [[Lionel]] sees human, orc, dragon, vampire, etc
- [[Lionel]] goes upstairs and finds a few things
	- bunch of gold, tarnished silverware, giant steel manicles, jars filled with blood, and a jar with a giant's eye with a bite taken out of it
	- [[Lionel]] and [[Effarig]] take two children each to bring downstairs
		- It would be best to leave these with [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]]
- [[Aeceran]] notices something metal in the furnace ash
	- [[Aeceran]] goes over to find a 2ft long lockbox
		- He tries to mage hand it open to find it is locked
	- Looking closer it is made of tin or lead and very thickly walled
		- There are some holes and dents in the side 
- [[Aeceran]] takes the box to the door and looks out on [[Revach]] 
	- [[Revach]] is curled up in the rain with light coming from his hands
	- [[Aeceran]] makes his clothes warm before returning inside
- [[Effarig]] and [[Lionel]] make it downstairs with the babies and see [[Aeceran]] with the lockbox
	- Everyone starts searching for a key only finding a potted mushroom that shrieks, rotten cloths and toys, and a still beating heart in a mason jar
	- [[Lionel]] attemts to pick the lock but feels resistance, stopping with the thought of the door to B.O.M. Bakery, minutes earlier
		- [[Aeceran]] angles the lock away from us and has a mage hand trigger the trap 
		- [[Lionel]] attempts again to open the box but is unable to get into it
		- After some prying, [[Aeceran]] makes a hole in the side of the box and coins and green light start pouring out
- [[Lionel]] goes to check on [[Revach]] saying, "They are lovely" before going back inside, [[Revach]] behind
- The last of the coins flow from the box and a gem comes out
	- They are [[05 Faerun|Faerun]] minted coins mostly and the gem is the size of a pinecone, glowing green 
- [[Effarig]] realized the children that aren't crying are soul-less like others we have seen
- We gather our things and head toward [[St. Andral's Church]]
	- [[Effarig]] takes the green gem feeling that it is nature based, and [[Aeceran]] takes the giant eye in a jar

## Wound Licking and Shopping
The crew make it to [[St. Andral's Church]] and explain what happened
- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] says he could have helped 
	- He, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], and [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] come to help take care of the babies
	- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] says we should have waited to take on the hags
- While we were gone a [[Vistani]] couple came saying there was a missing child
- [[Lionel]] speaks with [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] alone asking about "the third eye"  but he knows nothing

Time for a short rest to recover from the fight
- Role play happens with handing out hot stones and towels
- [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] speaks with [[Revach]] and [[Effarig]]
- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] get into a whisper fight before [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] goes to apologize to [[Aeceran]]
- Following that, [[Lionel]] awkwardly goes to get some blood from [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] to test 
	- It is repulsed by the [[Red Gem]]
	- [[Aeceran]] asks to be tested as well but his blood is completely unaffected
- [[Aeceran]] speaks with [[Revach]] about his culture which he says he is no longer a part of
	- [[Aeceran]] offers to give him a part of his culture demonstrating a braid on [[Lionel]]
	- [[Revach]] accepts and has [[Aeceran]] braid his hair
- [[Lionel]] wants to check out the green gem so [[Effarig]] hands it over
	- Holding it, it reminds him of the last time he was in nature 
	- The magic isn't an enchantment on the gem but the gem iteself

A guard comes by and says the trial of [[Stella Wachter]] is to be postponed until tomorrow due to the rain
- With some time to kill and feeling battered, we decide to go shopping for stuff to make us better at killing things 
	- We gather some things, [[Aeceran]] taking a giant manacle, and head to [[Thimdul's Armaments]]
- [[Piersym Rowley]] has made us a few things 
	- [[Aeceran]] gets new whips made of chain
	- [[Revach]] gets a new maul that is significantly lighter
	- [[Effarig]] gets a new longsword with a serrated edge
	- [[Lionel]] gets a rapier, similar to the one he has but thinner with a diamond tip
- [[Aeceran]] asks about armor and [[Piersym Rowley]] says something about his mentor and an armorer in Krezk who goes by Grygori
	- He will make leather armor
	- [[Lionel]] asks about Krezk and learns it is a small town on the outskirts
	- It is known for being close to the Wizard of Wines
- Continuing to kill time in the rain, we leave and go see if the apothecary is still around
	- [[Lionel]] looks in the windows and around [[Third Eye Potions & Sundries]] to find the shop empty and nothing standing out 
- Out of things to do in town we decide to trek out to the [[Vistani]] camp outside the city

## The Missing Girl
On the way to the camp
- [[Lionel]] holds the green gem up to a tree and moss quickly grows on the bark 
- The tree starts growing around the gem, encapsulating it
	- [[Lionel]] pulls it out as the tree leaks the brownish-blackish sap

Making it to the camp
- Large tent in center with a few [[Vistani]] with swords
	- Wagons surround it but there are very few horses about
- A body is tied to a tree, charred and continually being struck with lightning that we have been seeing for days
- A man stumbles down the path, drunk and sees us, mumbling about damning [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]
	- We say we are here to help and he points us to the tent 
		- People there discussing what to do next to find Aribella
		- He asks if we are looking for a way out of [[03 Barovia|Barovia]] and we say no but will let him know if we change our minds
- [[Aeceran]] goes and warms the horses that are out in the rain
- Looking at the charred body, it was human
	- [[Lionel]] makes out colorful scraps of clothing
- Outside of the center tent are many empty casks of wine
	- [[Aeceran]] pokes his head in and hears, "Aleksi got what he deserved"
	- There are some [[Vistani]] standing around a map
- We pop in and [[Aeceran]] asks what happened to the man on the tree
	- The seeming man in charge says they are looking for someone's daughter
	- That man is Aleksi, who was supposed to be looking after the girl, Arabella
	- Most of the woods around here have been scoured
	- Some of the greys (dusk elves) offered to go to Lake Zarovich but they have not heard from them 
		- Asks us to go and check on them 

Ask a few questions before we go
- The apothecary is not here and the main guy here doesn't know where she went off to
- [[Aeceran]] asks where the fletcher is and he went off with the group that went north

We are ordered to go north and others are told to go elsewhere
- We begin heading that way making it to Lake Zarovich in about an hour
- [[Effarig]] checks out [[Lionel]]'s teeth, they are weird and more than is to be expected for a normal person
