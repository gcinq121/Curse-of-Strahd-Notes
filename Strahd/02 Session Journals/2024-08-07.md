---
##  [[Van Richten's Tower]]
During his watch at night, [[Revach]] sees a tall cylinder of blue electricity shoot into the sky maybe half a mile away
- It does not give off any sound and is from the direction we are traveling

We wake up and continue on
- Eventually we make it to a foggy clearing cut to the lake 
- An old decrepit tower stands on the edge
	- On it's steps is Richtavio, bruised and bloody with [[Lionel]]'s raven on his shoulder
	- He says he fell through the scaffolding trying to sneak in
- We tell him about what happened two days ago in [[Vallaki]]
- He says he lied about this being **his** place
	- He has only made it in once before and this time the raven scared him and he fell
	- It is where the famed monster hunter Van Richten trained to kill [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]
	- We are informed that the front door is, "shocking"
		- The door is decorated with symbols that after some talking we decide are poses
		- [[Lionel]] does the poses and the door unlocks
- Before we go in, [[Aeceran]] decides to climb up the wall and scout it
	- The tower is very slippery but he is able to scale it and see it is mostly burnt out below where Richtavio stayed
- [[Lionel]] figures that the tower shouldn't be standing with all the damage done to it
	- Richtavio says some think Van Richten built it but it must be much older
	- [[Lionel]] thinks it is more intricate than the buildings of the steel city, made of ornate blackstone
		- He finds KHZ carved into a stone near the bottom
	- [[Aeceran]] finds the work similar to that of [[Castle Ravenloft]]
	- Before we enter, [[Lionel]] can feel a "stillness" in the air around the tower
- We go through the door and push past a curtain to see the first floor
	- There is an indentation in the center of the rom with chains on the four sides of it
	- Clay golems stand next to the chains and [[Lionel]] sees that they are very intricately made 
	- There are moldy barrels scattered around that were once filled with food
	- [[Lionel]] goes to the indentation which we assume is an elevator platform and the golems reach out their hands to the chains
		- He says, "up" and the golems pull the chains, hoisting him to the next level
- [[Revach]] notices light coming from the golem's armpits where the clay is thinner
	- He also notices he doesn't have the same access to magic he usually does 

[[Lionel]] says up until he hits the third floor which is much nicer than the burned out floors before it
- It feels like someone has been there recently with sheets on the bed and no dust
- There are two suits of armor of fine make in the room
- Everyone else makes their way up and gathers in the clean room
	- [[Lionel]] finds some schematics on the desk and notes in a hidden compartment
		- Schematics for the tower, [[The Windmill]], a really fancy wagon, and an airship
		- The notes are about killing [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]
	- [[Effarig]] remembers hearing Van Richten before 
		- He is a half-elf monster hunter
		- The [[Church of Kelemvor]] considers him a vigilante
		- The last heard about him was 300 years ago in the forgotten realms
	- [[Aeceran]] has heard the name said with a disgusted tone
		- He worked in the last two assassination attempts against [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]
		- [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] has said to keep an eye out for him
- The notebook is meticulously and cleanly written while the folded note is not 
- [[Lionel]]catches the smell of something chemically sweet
	- Leads him to a locked chest and he is able to open it
	- A jar filled with translucent oil and something unidentifiable
	- A scroll on top of another notebook 
		- "Interrogation Note"
		- It is a log of an interrogation he did of what seems to be a warewolf
	- A severed head in a jar
		- A [[Vistani]] man with his face half transformed into a muzzle
	- A map with a location north of Krezk marked and one where the amber temple is
	- [[Lionel]] looks at the suit of armor and it looks like a mech
		- It has the initials KHZ on its heel which are also on the tower schematics
		- RVR are on the airship and the wagon schematics
- We ask Richtavio if he knows anything about Van Richten but he just knows the name

Richtavio asks [[Aeceran]] to talk downstairs and the both go down 
- He gives him a violin he can't seem to get to work 
- [[Aeceran]] asks him if he knows anything about St. Andral 
	- Only that he was no friend of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]
- Richtavio mounts up and starts to leave

When everyone returns to the ground floor [[Lionel]] sends a raven to Richtavio
- We forgot to give him [[Arabella]]
- He is not super thrilled but he will do it
- She mounts up with him and they head off

[[Lionel]] tries to pull a gem out of the clay golem elevator helpers
- This wakes them up and they fuck us up
- The griffins on the tower also come to life and attack us
- After some fighting and [[Lionel]] letting go of the gem, we think we are in the clear but the tower collapses
- [[Lionel]] gets 3 more [[Red Gem]] and harvests some things off the golems
