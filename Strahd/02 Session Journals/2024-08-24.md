## A Late Host
We leave [[Van Richten's Tower]] and make our way right to [[Castle Ravenloft]]
- We get word somehow that Richtavio got [[Arabella]] to the mist 
- In [[Vallaki]], [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] and [[Victor Vallakovich|Victor]] feel defeated after [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] interrupted the trial

We arrive without any issues on the road
- We are welcomed by Rahadin, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s right hand man, and a servant, Helga
	- He leads us through the entryway which is as opulent as you would expect 
- Through cracked bronze doors is a grand dining room
	- A man is playing electric organ at the end of the room
	- Three women are seated at the end of the table
- Rahadin seats us where we find notes prepared for each of us
	- We each have some sort of deal presented to each of us and our responses are set in our wine choice for the night
	- The three woman are introduces as Ludmilla, Anastrasya, and Volenta
	- They will be hosting until [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] is able to join us
- A man, not fully human comes in and asks for our wine order, everyone except [[Lionel]] chooses the red 
	- All the servants we have seen appear rough and wear ragged cloths
	- One of them with nicer clothes looks very similar to [[Mad Mary]]

A course of salads is brought out and at the end, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] strides in through the doors and goes to the head of the table 
- We are asked to stand and dance for a bit with the brides rotating through the party members

Eventually everyone is seated again and [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] offers to answer a question we have
- We ask about St. Andral 
- [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] says he knew him well, with some malice in his voice
- His name was Leo Delismiya and he was a barbarian mercenary that was in his brother's honor guard
- When Sergei's guards turned of [[Castle Ravenloft|Strahd's Castle]], Leo struck the killing blow
- He rose again and went after Leo, chasing him to the church in [[Vallaki]]
	- Leo pleaded to let the people go or give them food, Leo was the first spawn of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]


## Betrayal at the House on the Hill
After the macabre story, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] asks us to meet him in his study while the meal is prepared
- We head up after him, Leaving [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] in the dining room
- (IDK what this line means but it is in my notes, "Arcane potions provided by Lief Leipseig")

Head up to the study through some dusty rooms
- There is a portrait that looks exactly like [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]
	- It is framed similar to the one of the steel city we saw in the well bunker ([[2024-04-27#Mechanical Mantids]])
	- (Done around the same time)
- [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] says he promised some things to us
	- Talks with [[Lionel]] about The Lord of Teeth thing 
		- Vampirism wasn't the only power sealed in the steel city
		- Pieces escaped when the mist was placed around [[03 Barovia|Barovia]]
		- [[Lionel]] is "blessed" with one of these powers
- [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] believes he has a betrayer
	- He had a reading with [[Madam Eva]] who said a woman close to him was trading away secrets
	- He has asked but nobody has admitted to it
	- If we find who it is, he will give each of us a favor
- He says to be careful in [[Castle Ravenloft|The Castle]], he doesn't have complete controll
- The next course is in an hour, bring our findings then 

We head off on our investigation
- Feeling safe in [[Castle Ravenloft|The Castle]], [[Aeceran]] removes the ring they have on and their more human features give way to those of a dhampir
- We start by going up a staircase and overlook the battlements
	- There are suits of armor patrolling
- Keep moving and while searching come across one of the servants
	- The housekeeper, Helga asks for help in exchange for telling us where [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s  wives are likely to be
	- I think we said we would try and didn't get any info from her 
- Find another staircase and begin to head up
	- It wraps around the outside of a spire and in the middle at the top is a crystal heart that glows red 
	- Continue up, passing up locked doors and going as high as we can 
	- Come out on the top of this section and see some figures crawling over the roof 
	- Hear a laugh as we are swarmed with bats 
- After defeating the bats we see Ludmilla was watching and seems entertained
	- We are given the opportunity to interrogate her and with some prying she says Anastrasya is the most likely
	- She sometimes speaks out of turn or something like that my notes are patchy
- We keep exploring and find Escher
	- They think it is Anastrasya as well, she is a gossip and is often leaving [[Castle Ravenloft|The Castle]] on missions
	- They also say that Volenta has been spending a lot of time by herself on [[Castle Ravenloft|The Castle]] spires
