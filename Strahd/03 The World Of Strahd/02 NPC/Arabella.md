A [[Vistani]] girl who lived at the camp outside [[Vallaki]]
- Appears to be 16 or 17 years old
- She started to show magical prowess
- She is in love with a guy from Everlund that she met not long ago and wants to get back to him

She ran away from her camp ([[[2024-07-16]]) and tried to row across Lake Zarovich
- The party saved her ([[2024-07-20]]) and disguised her, promising to take her with them when they went to Krezk

- They left her in the care of Richtavio at the monster hunter's tower
