The tower of famed monster hunter Van Richten on Lake Baratok
- Met Richtavio there ([[2024-08-07]]) after he claimed it was "his place"

Mostly derelict except for the top room
- There are constructs guarding the bottom that also act as engines for the elevator
	- [[Lionel]] tried to steal a gem from the chest of one and it ended badly
- The top room is still pristine and contained some notes from the monster hunter still there after many years
