## The Dungeon
Not noted in the previous session
- We did find a way into the dungeons and got teleported around I think
	- Rahadin's help gets us there a second time and we are actually able to walk through
- We made our way to speak with Volenta
- She was in a room decorated entirely with bones on a lower level of [[Castle Ravenloft|The Castle]]
- I don't believe she had any ideas as to who would be the betrayer of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]
- [[Lionel]] was quite taken with her obsession with bones 

[[Lionel]] asks Volenta about going into the crypt 
- [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] doesn't like visitors there until their final rest

Head back to the staircase with the crystal heart to see how far down it goes
- Find a room with a blue mosaic in the center
- I believe it was a secret thing and opened up with a staircase leading down
- See an archway leading to a few room, the ceiling is covered in lichen
	- [[Lionel]] checks out the lichen and concludes it is not dangerous to his knowledge
- We explore, and while looking for traps, [[Lionel]] sees a scrap of cloth in the floor
	- Finds that it is the open end of a bag
	- After carefully opening it he finds 150 ep and a ring that doesn't seem to do anything when he puts it on
- Move through a passageway to a door
	- [[Lionel]] listens and hears quill on paper
	- Knocking, it stops and Rahadin opens the door, screams escaping the room as he does 
	- We ask him what he thinks about the betrayal
		- He is friends with Ludmilla and doesn't think she would
		- [[Effarig]] tries to sus out if he is lying but only finds he is angry anyone would betray [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]
		- He offers to take us to more interesting parts of [[Castle Ravenloft|The Castle]]
	- Ask him to take us to the dungeons and he scribbles something in a notebook before taking us there

We walk through the dungeons and come across a prisoner
- In one cell see the shaft of a maul
- In another see a skeleton with blue robes and some remaining long, grey hair
- There is a man hanging by his arms with chains 
	- There is water contained in his cell that comes right up to his chin as he pulls to stay above it
	- He says his name is Emil Toranesau and he was chased here by wolves
	- He was part of the Werewolf pack west of [[Van Richten's Tower|Lake Baratok]]
	- [[Aeceran]] puts together that this is the pack leader, Kiril Stoyonovich's, rival
	- [[Effarig]] pities this man and after deliberating, kills him to put him out of his misery
		- The man transforms into a werewolf as he dies
- [[Effarig]] is suddenly weakened and drops his sword
	- After a moment he picks it up and the hilt becomes electrum and the edges become silvered
	- Picking it up he feels many coins spilling out of another cell 
	- Going to open it we find a pile of electrum coins
		- Some have the mark of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], others are marked as minted in Mirabar in [[05 Faerun|Faerun]]
		- We take a little bit and continue through the dungeon
- [[Aeceran]] explores further into flooded areas by walking on the ceiling
	- He finds a room with a brazier and colored stones around it, an hourglass above
- The rest of the party tries to catch up with [[Aeceran]] and [[Effarig]] gets got by a creature
	- Instantly dragged through the water and into a cell
	- We fight off some ooze
	- After the battle [[Effarig]] finds a chute that would send someone into this cell 
		- It is slippery so [[Aeceran]] goes first to scout it and finds it safe
		- With half an hour before the next course, we go up the chute
