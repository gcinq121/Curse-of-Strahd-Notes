## My notes for a Curse of Strahd campaign

I am always looking to make these better so suggestions are welcome

All notes are in markdown format but can be viewed with any text editor although I use Obsidian to manage them

The most critical plugins for this vault are Advanced Tables, Dataview, Default New Tab Page, Folder Notes, and Leaflet
- Alternatively all of these and my settings are stored in the Strahd/.obsidian folder

I know some of the notes are messy, it should get cleaner as we get more information
- New versions will come out when I finish notes for a session or get up to date
