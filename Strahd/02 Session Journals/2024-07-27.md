- [[Effarig]] makes sure people vote only once, pulling out one person

[[Victor Vallakovich|Victor]] reads out every vote
- The count comes to 128-283, guilty
- As [[Victor Vallakovich|Victor]] gives the charge, banishment from [[Vallaki]], the sky begins to darken
- It gets dark as night as people begin to panic and scream
	- The sound of carriage wheels is heard as a black carriage rolls into the square
	- A dusk elf jumps down from the driver's seat and opens the door
- [[Strahd von Zarovich]] strides up to the stage as everyone is compelled to kneel before him

- The letter is an apology for his rude intrusion and insists we come to [[Castle Ravenloft]] to dine with [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]
	- This will take place on the new moon, in only 6 days

## Dinner Preparations
With our now limited time we decide we will go see Richtavio on [[Van Richten's Tower|Lake Baratok]]

Head back to [[St. Andral's Church]] where we find [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] shaken
- He wants to go with us to [[Castle Ravenloft]] and see what is going on in [[Castle Ravenloft|The Castle]]

	- He says he will speak with the guards as to why [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] was let in

- [[Lionel]] sends his raven ahead of us with a message to let Richtavio know we are headed there
- Things are relatively uneventful until [[Revach]] hears the flapping of fabric in the wind 
	- A skeleton is speared to a tree, still in its black cloak, skin in pieces covering the nearby trees
	- [[Arabella]] doesn't know it as an omen or recognize the symbol on the cloak
		- The party recognizes it as the symbol of Waterdeep
	- [[Aeceran]] climbs up the tree to take a look 
		- It appears the body fell directly on top of the tree, spearing them 
		- The flaps of skin begin to move and go after [[Aeceran]]
	- It isn't long before we take care of the skin come back to life
		- The cloak flutters down, it's fine black silk with red trim, the symbol of waterdeep in gold 
		- The skeleton seems dwarven
		- Besides the cloak there are only a few scraps of cloth
		- The skeleton has been here a while, the bones growing into the tree 
- We continue on until dark before making camp for the night
