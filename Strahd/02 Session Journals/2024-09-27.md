oneLiner: More exploration of Castle Ravenloft and we find out who has been betraying Strahd
---
## The Crypts
We make it up the chute and start to explore
- One way we find ourselves in the room with the brazier and gems but more dry than if we had followed [[Aeceran]]
- Through an entryway there are two wooden thrones overlooking a courtyard
	- They are well made but [[Lionel]] isn't able to glean anything from them 
	- There were once paintings on them but they have almost completely faded

Trying to find where we are going next we check doors finding two ways up
- [[Lionel]] can tell we are under the hall of bones where Volenta was 
- One set of stairs smells like paper and the other is very steep
- We decide to go up the paper smelling one 
	- There is a landing on the way up with a very large painting 
		- A man in gilded on a horse leading knights into battle
		- They all wear the Zarovich crest
		- The helm of the man in gilded armor is cracked
	- [[Lionel]] listens up the stairs to be cautious and makes out a fire, metal on metal, and then stone on stone only briefly
- Go all the way back down and head the other way in the chute hallway
	- The floor becomes red colored stone 
	- Make it to a room and we can feel this is deeper than we have been yet
	- The room is thick with fog and the floor is covered in much
	- Looking up the ceiling seems to move and we notice fields of bats 15 ft up

We made it to the crypts
- There are many sectioned off areas with stone coffins and belongings around
- We start looking for Piddlewick's tomb
	- I missed it somewhere but we talked with this guy's ghost and he said he had something for us in the crypt 
	- We did something like remove the cover on a harp
	- We are able to find it and [[Effarig]] and [[Revach]] are able to open the door 
	- In the front is a small box and [[Aeceran]] takes a look 
		- On top is a signed Joker card by Piddlewick that reads, "Have Fun!"
		- It is a deck of illusions
- Find the tomb of Sergei, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s brother behind a large gate
	- [[Effarig]]'s ring is as cold as ice
	- The coffin lays on a marble slab and is flanked by statues of angels
- [[Aeceran]] recognizes the name King Troisky as someone [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] bested in battle 

## The Betrayer
It has nearly been an hour and it feels about time to head back to the study
- When we reach it, Ludmilla is there, perusing the bookshelf
- We interrogate her a little more since she is here
	- She does go out on missions for [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] sometimes
	- She gets annoyed when [[Aeceran]] talks about her tactfulness and eloquence
	- Feels underutilized by [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], not just a messenger
	- [[Aeceran]] takes a jab, saying she has perhaps outlived her usefulness
- Ludmilla tries to influence the party, everyone going slack jawed, eyes glazed over except [[Effarig]]
	- [[Effarig]] can tell she is trying to change the other's memories
	- [[Effarig]] says she isn't going to change anything in his head and points a sword at her
- We begin fighting Ludmilla trying to stop her
	- [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] arrives late as usual and orders Ludmilla to stop
	- She grows wings and horns as darkness envelops her
	- [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] says to keep her where she is and disappears for a hot minute
	- Ludmilla pulls a "Freaky Friday" with [[Revach]] real quick
	- [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] returns with a book and starts to read off a spell
